abstract: >- 
  In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), a significant challenge is the prevailing lack of trust, particularly stemming from the opacity of how these models
  operate. This issue becomes especially critical in the medical domain, where gaining the trust of clinicians is paramount for the successful integration of AI into
  healthcare practices. Recognizing this concern, our proposed method addresses
  the trust deficit by introducing interpretability to AI models deployed in medical
  contexts. Specifically, we incorporate the Total Variation (TV) norm to improve
  the saliency-guided training algorithm, enhancing the transparency and effectiveness of the decision-making process. By employing the TV norm, clinicians
  can better comprehend and trust the AIâ€™s recommendations. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted tests on two distinct datasets in endoscopy,
  revealing not only an improvement in accuracy but also a notable enhancement
  in explainability. This dual benefit encourages the reliability of AI applications
  in the medical field and facilitates a more collaborative and informed partnership
  between AI systems and healthcare professionals.

abstract: >- 
  The goal of brain tumor segmentation is to aid in surgical planning. Traditional medical approaches focus on cellular differences, while AI methods, especially deep learning, process medical images. Despite progress, current deep learning models still require significant physician input to ensure accurate surgical maps, which is time-consuming.
  To improve this, the proposal suggests using reinforcement learning with human feedback, enabling machines to learn from physician interactions over time. This approach aims to reduce dependency on continuous expert input by gradually adopting physician decision-making strategies. The proposal also addresses key technical challenges such as network architecture design, segmentation in imbalanced data scenarios, and integration of medical features into the segmentation process.

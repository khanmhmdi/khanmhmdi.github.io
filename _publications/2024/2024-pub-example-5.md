abstract: >- 
  Healthcare insurance fraud imposes a significant financial and operational burden on medical
  systems, necessitating robust and scalable detection methods. This paper presents InSureNet, a novel framework
  based on Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) for provider-level fraud detection. Unlike conventional
  graph neural networks with fixed connectivity, GTNs automatically discover and learn compositional meta-
  paths, enabling the model to capture multi-hop, heterogeneous relationships embedded in healthcare data. By
  integrating meta-path induction with graph convolution, InSureNet effectively models higher-order dependencies
  and structural patterns among providers. We evaluate our approach on a publicly available healthcare fraud
  dataset, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-arts. Specifically, InSureNet achieves an improvement of
  6% in F1-score and 17% in ROC-AUC, highlighting its ability to detect complex fraud scenarios under class
  imbalance.

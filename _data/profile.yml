  <p>
    I am a deep learning and computer vision researcher, currently completing my B.Sc. in Computer Science at Shahid Beheshti University. My research focuses on interactive segmentation, distributed inference for Mixture-of-Experts models, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). I have collaborated with academic institutions such as UCLA and the University of Tehran, and contributed to several publications in top venues like IEEE COINS and Springer Nature journals.

  <p>
    I am particularly passionate about deploying scalable AI systems for real-time applications, and my work spans probabilistic modeling, symbolic mathematics using GNNs, and active learning. I also contribute as a teaching assistant in Data Science and Deep Learning courses.
